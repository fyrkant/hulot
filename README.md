# compotest
A simple React Component and Test generator

## Usage:
* `$ compotest <cool-component>`  
    => Generates a component called CoolComponent and a matching test file.
* `$ compotest -c <cool-component>`  
    => Generates component only, no test. (Why aren't you testing?!)
* `$ compotest -t <cool-component>`  
    => Generates test only, no component. (Yep, get testing!)
